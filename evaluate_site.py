Website Evaluation Stub
======================

This module provides a stub for evaluating a published website using microagents and Playwright.
It simulates analysis of the generated website and writes a development plan (devplan.nextsteps.md)
suggesting future improvements.

No real analysis is performed; all steps are illustrative only.
