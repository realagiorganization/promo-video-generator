Promo Video Generator
====================

This module provides a placeholder workflow for generating a promotional video from README content.
It demonstrates the intended orchestration steps without calling external services. All functions are stubs
showing where integrations with Codex, VEO3, Docker, and Playwright would occur in a real implementation.

Workflow:
    1. Read README.md for source text.
    2. Expand README content into a dialogue script (stub).
    3. Render slides from the script (stub).
    4. Synthesize a video from slides and script (stub).

No external dependencies or credentials are required. Intended for illustration only.
